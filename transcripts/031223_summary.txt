- Dimension reduction clustering is typically done in methods like Tsn E.Topic: Machine Learning in Data Science

Clustering Models:
- There are many clustering models, each with different advantages.
- One example is hierarchical clustering, which starts with everything in one cluster and splits into smaller clusters.
- Another model is K-means, which fixes the number of clusters and finds the best ones.
- Data scientists mix and match these models.

Dimension Reduction:
- Clustering can be combined with dimension reduction, such as using the method TsnE.
- Data scientists have many tools for clustering, depending on the application.

Unsupervised Learning:
- Unsupervised learning can group data into clusters, and a separate prediction model can be built for each cluster.
- This often gives better results because models can be tailored to each cluster.

Dimension Reduction Process:
- The dimensions obtained must make clinical sense and capture the variability of the data.
- The analysis must also be communicated to end users in a way that they understand and can use.

Risk Scores:
- Risk scores can be calculated independently of clustering.

- Discriminant analysis is a supervised learning process used to predict if someone has a disease or not based on certain parameters.
- There are risks in using medical data collected in one country to create models and conclusions about a different population because humans are not all alike.
- Thresholds for what constitutes a disease may differ from country to country due to environmental circumstances, genetic institutions, or predispositions of populations.
- Clustering methods can be used to statistically combine attributes and separate people into clusters, and the algorithm determines the rules around which clustering is best done.
- Blockchain can be used to maintain the sanctity of the supply chain of medicine to ensure patients receive the right medicine with the right formulations.

- In healthcare, simple rules can be put in place to reduce the need for big data, but AI systems still need to do more.
- The speaker cannot address the AI question at the moment.
- More discussions on the topic will be held later.

Topic: Banking and Risk Management
- Risk management is the most important issue in banking as bank failures can lead to severe consequences.
- Banks fail because they are unable to give money back when there is a run on the bank, as depositors' money is being used to give loans.
- This is a feature of banking, not a bug, and all banks must be able to manage risks like operational, credit, and market risks.
- Credit risk involves measuring the probability of default when giving loans, and there are standards for this in many banks.Summary:

- Banking has inherent risks that banks must manage, including operational, credit, and market risks.
- Compliance, organizational challenges, and theft are other risks banks face.
- Banks use careful standards for credit risk assessment, including measuring the probability of default and loss given default.
- Cybersecurity is a significant risk in banking, especially as more transactions are done digitally through fintech.
- Legacy systems present challenges to maintaining data integrity and being able to change systems easily.
- The challenge is to create data that is portable across systems and not tied to legacy systems.can prevent fraud and financial losses. The following are subcategories of the transcript:

- Data Integrity Maintenance: The lifetime of an account is longer than the lifetime of an IT system, posing challenges for data maintenance in databases. Inflexibility in data storage due to legacy systems can result in data integrity issues.
- Data Portability: Creating data that can be easily transferred across systems is a difficult problem to solve, as exemplified by the Y2K problem 20-23 years ago. This challenge raises questions about how IT professionals can build robust systems that are compatible with data scientists' work.
- Compliance: Compliance refers to regulations that govern data security, risk management, business standards, and financial regulations. Compliance is crucial in ensuring consistency with regulations and preventing regulatory violations and financial losses.
- Customer Experience: The nature of customer experience has evolved due to changes in technology, such as the rise of online banking, leading to fewer bank branches. This evolution necessitates understanding customer needs and preferences to adapt to changing circumstances.

Moreover, the transcript discusses risk management in the context of operational risk, specifically the ability to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. The goal is to identify key attributes that can flag suspicious activities quickly, allowing financial institutions to prevent fraud and minimize losses.Sub Categories:

- Decision trees ask a series of questions to create a predictive rule on whether a transaction is genuine or not.
- Transaction amount is usually the root of the tree, and the end notes are suspicious or genuine.Topic: Supervised Learning & Decision Trees

- Decision tree is a predictive rule that asks a series of questions to determine if a transaction is genuine or suspicious.
- This is an example of supervised learning, which is a type of machine learning that uses labeled data to make predictions or decisions.
- The advantage of this kind of supervised learning is that it is explainable, i.e., the rules can be understood by the users.
- However, the problem with decision trees is that they can be too complex and unstable, leading to overfitting and poor performance.
- To overcome this, modern algorithms use ensemble methods, such as random forests or boosting, to combine multiple decision trees and improve robustness.
- These algorithms are widely used for classification tasks, such as image recognition or fraud detection.
- The principles of supervised learning are also the foundation for other advanced AI techniques, such as neural networks or deep learning.
- Inferential methods can be used to improve datasets or fill in missing values, such as imputation in recommendation systems.
- More questions on the banking industry and decision-making may be addressed in future sessions.Topic: AI, Data Science, Banking, and Risk Management
